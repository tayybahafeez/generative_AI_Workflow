# generative_AI_Workflow
This repository demonstrates a complete Generative AI workflow, covering data preparation, embedding generation, retrieval, and response generation with LLMs. The goal is to show how different components—speech-to-text, text-to-vector embeddings, RAG, and model inference—fit together into a practical AI pipeline.
